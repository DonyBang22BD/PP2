# TUPLES

#For instance
tup1 = (7,8,14)
tup2 = (7,18,10)
print(tup1<tup2)

#2
print((10,20)<(10,25)) # output: true/at least 1 of them must be true and one of them would be equal
print((10,20)==(10,25))# output: false/all of them must be true
print((10,20)>(10,25)) # output: false/it's false, because at least 1 of them must be true

# And in tuple you can't compare different data types(like in C++)
